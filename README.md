Analysing comments as positive, negative or neutral. This model enables to identify sentiments 


Sentiments Analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language      processing(NLP : Application or technique to the analysis of natural language and speech) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text.  This analysis is used to predict the particular data in one way speech , for example : positive , negative or neutral.
In today's digital age, the sheer volume of text data generated on platforms like social media, customer reviews, and news articles presents a valuable opportunity to understand human sentiments. 
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis system to classify text into one of three categories: positive, neutral, or negative. By harnessing the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques, the system aims to process text efficiently and deliver accurate sentiment predictions.


The primary challenge addressed in this project is to develop a system capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of text samples in a large and diverse dataset. Key issues tackled include:
Text Preprocessing: Raw text often contains noise, including special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant data such as URLs. A robust preprocessing pipeline is necessary to clean the data for analysis.
Imbalanced Data: Sentiment datasets often have an unequal distribution of classes, making it essential to build models that are effective even under these conditions.
Model Selection: Choosing the most effective machine learning or deep learning model to balance accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
Scalability: Developing a system that can process and predict sentiment for large datasets or real-time inputs.
Interactive Usability: Creating a user-friendly interface where users can input custom text and receive sentiment predictions.
